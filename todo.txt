First remove all the pre-existing file odf openCV from your computer manually and reinstall it and then see if the
program runs or not.
if it runs then do the following:
    1) access the laptop webcam using openCV and integrate it with your code.
    2) Then create a time-stamp variable and store time into it
    3) Create a .csv file and store (total count, Live count, Time_stamp) into it.
    4) Collect the data for 2 or 3 days.
    5) Then create a rolling average function in it to find the peak time and live count for that interval and return that value.


    Time stamp display DONE
    access webcam:
        1) webcam access DONE
        2) Frames messed up: previous frame is not getting away and live count is not decreasing. [SOLVED]

            Solutions:
                a) create a new model for personID and frame creation.
                b) Understand each and every part of this code and make required changes.

       3) Creating a csv file and store data:
            format: (total count, Live Count, Time_stamp)
            issue: Too massive data
                solution: Change the datetime format from [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.MiliSeconds] -> [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]
